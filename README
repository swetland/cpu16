This is a collection of little open source FPGA hobby projects
--------------------------------------------------------------

The build system can target nextpnr-ice40, nextpnr-ecp5, (Lattice
ICE40 and ECP5 family parts), verilator (simulation), and vivado
(Xilinx parts).

Projects are defined in project/*.def and all buildable projects
can be listed with "make" and built with "make <projectname>" or
"make all"

Final build products are deposited in out/... and intermediate
build products, logs, and so on, in out/-nextpnr-/{projectname}/...,
out/-vsim-/{projectname}/..., etc.
